The OpenSooq-simulation project is a web application that aims to replicate the basic functionality of the real website "OpenSooq" using the ASP.NET MVC framework. OpenSooq is a popular online marketplace platform that allows users to buy and sell various goods and services.

In the simulation project, users will be able to perform the following basic functionalities:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account on the platform, providing essential details like name, email, and password. Once registered, they can log in securely using their credentials.

Product Listing: Authenticated users can list items they want to sell on the platform. They can upload images, add descriptions, and set a price for each item.

Product Searching and Browsing: Visitors and registered users can search for products by using keywords or browsing through different categories. The application will display a list of relevant products based on the search criteria.

Product Details: Users can view detailed information about a particular product, including its description, images, and the seller's contact information.

Messaging: Users can send messages to sellers to inquire about products or negotiate prices. User Profile: Each user will have a profile page where they can view their listed items, edit personal information, and see their messaging history.

Admin Panel: An admin panel will be available to authorized administrators. They can manage users, listings, and reported content, ensuring the platform's smooth operation.

Search Filters: Users can utilize various filters, such as location, price range, and product condition, to refine their search results.

Responsive Design: The application will be designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for an optimal user experience.

It's essential to note that the OpenSooq-simulation project is for learning and demonstration purposes and may not include all the features found on the real OpenSooq website. Nevertheless, it provides a practical opportunity to practice ASP.NET MVC development skills and gain hands-on experience in building a basic online marketplace application.
